# ESP32-NUT current development status

Read this after [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), confirm it with live Git, and then
load only the document required for the active task. This is the single active
handoff for every agent, including context-limited agents. Do not preload the
archive, source tree, or project chat. Completed release evidence is in
[archive/](archive/README.md), not this startup handoff.

## Snapshot

| Field | Current fact |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical branch | `main` / `origin/main` |
| Published release | `v2.7.1` at `163e3d08d`; resolve live Git before acting |
| Worktree at update | Clean |
| Target | YD-ESP32-23 / ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8, ESP-IDF v6.0.2, `esp32s3` |
| Required boundaries | LAN-only HTTPS `443`; read-only NUT `3493`; retired `8080` refused; ADMIN/CSRF and bearer-scope rules preserved |
| Management architecture | `management.c` is the root-policy, HTTPS-lifecycle, and factory-reset orchestration boundary; focused modules own the remaining management concerns |
| Last observed target result | v2.7.1 was installed and all requested release tests passed; detailed evidence is archived |

## Current objective

Begin from live `main`, not a historical feature branch. Start
`feature/nut-disconnect-invalidation`, read the active development plan, then
inspect only the UPS-state source needed to reproduce stale values after a
disconnect. Define the invalidation acceptance boundary before implementation;
do not change device state without fresh authorization and preflight.
